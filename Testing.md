## Unit Tests
Currently, we have no unit tests for the front-end, however we do plan on having this done after the rest of the UI is finished. As for the back-end, John and LaFon have been working to ensure that IDs are matched up with comments correctly.

## System Tests
We don't have any system tests implemented. However we do plan to have some system tests for the API, front-end, and back-end once each part is complete.

## Acceptance Tests
There currently are no formal acceptance tests. However, we have consistently been in contact with our sponsor to make sure that our system is complying with the project requirements and if it is acceptable for delivery. We plan to do this once we have established contact with their team for QA.
