# OU Capstone Project for Tailwind  

Social media managers for companies must respond to a large quantity of comments, posts, and replies. Doing so quickly with quality responses is a major concern of Tailwind.  


We are interested in two modes of response.  


The first mode is quick response – replying with a few emojis and a stock phrase. For this, we analyze the sentiment of a comment, and map that numerical score to a set of appropriate responses. The client can choose from these responses to reply with. For example, if a comment is negative the stock responses might be “We’re sorry to hear that.” or “How can we help?” where positive comments might have “Glad to hear it!” and “We’re happy to help!” along with appropriate emojis. This is useful for situations like Instagram comments, where the content is largely insubstantial but we are interested in driving engagement quickly.  
  

The second mode is longer form responses, suitable for email responses and more specific customer service requests. We are developing an assistive typing mechanism to aid this, including autocomplete, suggested next words, and even suggested ways to complete sentences that the client may choose from. We are accomplishing this by training a recurrent neural network on social media data. The net maps a vector of characters (where each character is a unique one-hot vector of length N where N is the number of unique characters) to a single character output. Text is predicted by iteratively generating text one character a time until a terminal character (a space or punctuation).  
  

Our machine learning models are implemented using Python. We are hosting a Flask server on GCP to create a RESTful API to access these models from the frontend, which will be implemented with React. Since React can be used on both a mobile and desktop platform, we thought using this framework would be the best option.  
  
  

## Design  

The following is the design of the “quick response” application. This is a seperate application from the predictive text project, which is implemented only as a generic text box component which can be used in a variety of applications.  
  
    
  

Application context and external interactions with the system  
  
    
  

The application is to be used by a social media manager to quickly respond to comments on social media using stock phrases based on the sentiment of the comment. There are two external actors:  
  

#### 1.  The user  

- A social media manager  
- Selects response with which to reply to comments  
 - Responses are either an emoji or a textual response, each generated by the quick response API based on the comment text.  
    

#### 2.  External social media APIs  

- The application is a standalone client. Comments are fetched from social media (e.g. Twitter, Instagram) official APIs. When the user replies to a comment, this is also done by submitting a POST request to the social media API. As such our architecture does not implement a model view for storing this data.  
 - Implementation note: We cannot access Instagram API without enterprise level. For the purposes of this course/implementation, we might implement our own small database to store comments in. We will treat this as an “external” DB because it would be on deployment.
