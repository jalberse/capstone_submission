### Running The REST API

TODO: Add reference for pipenv installation instructions.
First make sure pipenv is installed to manage the python dependencies. Once it is installed you can activate the python environment using

```
python3.7 -m pipenv shell
```

Once in the environments shell, you can start the API using
```
python app.py
```

This will make the API calls possible on the local host port 5000 (http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

TODO: Add instructions for GET and POST request info once the format is decided
TODO: Add instructions to make REST API available over the internet.

### Testing REST API
TODO: Add the testing info from Insomnia either here or somewhere else easily accessible.
